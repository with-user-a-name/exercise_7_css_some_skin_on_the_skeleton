# Exercise 7: CSS - Some Skin on the Skeleton

**Note:** The result of this exercise must be shown to the teacher and approved before it can be considered completed.

In the previous assignment, you created an HTML skeleton that may not have looked very appealing or impressive. Today, you will use CSS to style the skeleton so that it resembles a website someone might want to visit — but don’t be disappointed if it doesn't look fantastic. It’s still a very simple page. Use the knowledge you’ve gained from the video material to improve its appearance.

The following requests are outlined:

- Text and video content should be centered
- Foreground and background colors should relate to the movie (check the posters)
- The list of links should be horizontal
- The footer should be 50px high and have a different background color than the rest of the page.

Take this opportunity to experiment a bit with CSS. The requests are a minimum, not a maximum. Try to make the page look pleasant.
